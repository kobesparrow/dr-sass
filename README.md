###Memoize
Memoize is a solo project assigned during the final week of mod two at Turing School in Denver, CO. The project is intended to solidify the use of React and an opportunity to demonstrate test driven development and incorporate SCSS. The app is a Dr. Seuss-themed flashcard app aimed at teaching SCSS terms and funadmentals.

###Install / Setup

- run npm install
- run npm start
- open localhost:3000 (unless otherwise instructed by your terminal)

###Learning Goals
To implement React from a green field project state to completion. Specifically within React â€” to understand when to make a component stateful and when not. Beyond that, the most important goal for me was to grasp testing and understand the syntax of Jest and Enzyme and how to test events and methods. Ancillary goal was to incorporate SCSS.
